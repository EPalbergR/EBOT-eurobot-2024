This repository contains code and 3D models for the robot used by E-BOT team in the 2024th edition of the spanish national Eurobot competition

## Content

* `t-photos` contains photos of the team 
* `robot-photos` contains photos of the robots
* `video` contains the video.md file with the link to a video of the robots
* `schemes` contains one or several schematic diagrams in form of JPEG, PNG or PDF of the electromechanical components illustrating all the elements (electronic components and motors) used in the vehicle and how they connect to each other.
* `src` contains code of control software for all components which were programmed to participate in the competition
* `models` is for the files for models used by 3D printers to produce the robot's elements.
* `other` is for other files which can be used to understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition. 
## Introduction

_This part must be filled by participants with the technical clarifications about the code: which modules the code consists of, how they are related to the electromechanical components of the vehicle, and what is the process to build/compile/upload the code to the vehicleâ€™s controllers._
